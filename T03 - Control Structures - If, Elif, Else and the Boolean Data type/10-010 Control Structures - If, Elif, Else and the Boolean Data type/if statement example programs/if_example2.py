# =============  Writing if statements ==================
# if statements are a type of control structure which control the flow of logic within a program.
# if statements contain a condition.
# Conditions are statements that can only evaluate to a boolean value, True or False.
# If the condition is True then the indented statements are executed; if the condition is False then the indented statements are skipped.
# In Python, if statements have the following general syntax:
#               if condition :
#                       indented statements

#This is an example Python program demonstrating if statements.

name = input("Enter your name: \n")

if len(name) == 0:
	print ("You didn't enter anything.")

if len(name) > 10:
	print ("You've got a long name.")

print(name)

#Run this program. Change your input to get different outputs due to the if statements.
