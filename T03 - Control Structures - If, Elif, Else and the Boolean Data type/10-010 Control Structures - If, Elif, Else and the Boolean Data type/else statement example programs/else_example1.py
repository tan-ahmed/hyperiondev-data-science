# ========= if-else Statements =========
# An if statement together with an else statement is known as an if-else statement
# The else statement represents an alternative path for the flow of logic if the condition of the if statement turns out to be False.
# If the if condition turns out to be True, the statements in the indented block following the if statement are executed.
# If the if condition turns out to be False, the statements in the indented block following the if statement are skipped,
# and the statements in the indented block following the else statement are executed.

# In Python, the general if-else syntax is:
# if condition :
#	indented Statements
# else:
#	indented Statements

#This is an example Python program demonstrating if-else statements.

#Run this program. Change your input to get different outputs due to the if statements.
