# ========= Another elif example ===========
# elif is short for else if.
# This allows you to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is False.

# ************ Example 1 ************
num_str = input("Enter a number, or enter 'NO' to stop the program: ") 
if num_str == "2":
    num_int = int(num_str)
    #string input was cast to int
    print ("The string '2' was successfully cast to an integer")
elif num_str == "3":
     num_int = int(num_str)
     #string input was cast to int 
     print ("The string '3' was successfully cast to an integer")
else:
    print ("The word 'NO' can't be cast to an int.")
    # Entering NO causes the print function to be executed.
    
# Entering anything other than 2, 3, or NO does not result in any output as no
# further options are not defined in the code.
# What happens if you enter a number other than 2 or 3? Can you adapt the program
# to output the text "I don't know what to do with this number for any number higher 
# than 3? Try it!
# Try entering 'no' rather than 'NO'. What happens? Why is Python's response not
# case sensitive in this case?
# Also try creating processing instructions for other input, and adding output for 
# every option.
