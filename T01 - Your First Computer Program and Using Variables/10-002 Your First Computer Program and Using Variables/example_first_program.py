# ************ Example 3 ************
# The following input commands will get the user's name and age.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
city = input("Enter your city: ")

# The variable 'name' stores what the user entered into the box as a string.
# The variable 'age' also stores what the user entered into the box as a string.
# Now, when you try running this file, notice the output produced by the 
# following command.
print(name, age, city)
print("{} from {}, is {} years old!".format(name, city, age))

# A common SYNTAX error you could make above is by forgetting to add a closing 
# bracket ‘)’. Remember that all opening brackets ‘(’ , require a matching 
# closing one!


#  ========= Running Python files =========
# Now that you know how to write code, it's time to learn how to execute your 
# code to see what the output is.
# Let's 'RUN' this Python file and take a look at what output it produces (if any).
# When you write Python code, you'll have to run it often to test that your 
# programs are doing what you'd like them to do.

# There are different ways to 'run' Python files.

#  ========= OPTION 1: Run from Visual Studio Code GUI -- THE EASY WAY =========
# The easiest way to run Python files and this program is through a GUI 
# (Graphical User Interface). Open the terminal via the View menu bar.
# Press F5 on your keyboard to RUN the Python file and the output will appear in
# the terminal within Visual Studio Code. You can use this method to run ANY 
# Python file (i.e. a file with a .py extension). If there is an error in your 
# code, the code won't run and the error will be printed out in the terminal.

# Errors are things like trying to add two variables that aren't the same data 
# type, or using a variable that isn't declared! (i.e. if you say num = num1+num2
# and you haven't said what num1 and num2 are above this statement!) 
# We'll talk about errors more later.

# Play around with this program. Change statements and delete things, run the
# code and see what happens.

# We advise that you complete all tasks and open all example files in Visual
# Studio Code.
# Perhaps create a shortcut to Visual Studio Code on your desktop so that you 
# can access it faster.
# You can also use Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code to view the example.py files, but Notepad++ can 
# only be used to view the text of a code. You can't run programs with Notepad++.

#  ========= OPTION 2: Use any GUI/IDE that you want.  -- ADVANCED =========
# An IDE is a program like Visual Studio Code.
# You get many programs that let you run code within them.
# Some of these IDEs are more complicated than others.
# See http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors for a huge list of different 
# IDEs that can run Python files.
# As long as you know how to use Visual Studio Code, you can complete our 
# entire course. We do NOT recommend using another editor as issues may occur requiring extra support.
